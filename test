Hi I have developed a sample test file in Articulate Storyline 2 and published it as SCORM 1.2 which don't seem to call the right function call ( LMSSetValue cmi.core.score.raw ) in Moodle LMS. In order to pass the score value to Moodle, i used the following JS code in a trigger on timeline start at end of quiz : /*Get player to reference*/ var player = GetPlayer(); /*get LMS API*/ var lmsAPI = parent; /*set score; the first number is the score*/ lmsAPI.SetScore(player.GetVar("14543GameScore"), 100, 0); /*set status; possible values: "completed","incomplete", "failed", "passed"*/ if (player.GetVar("14543GameScore")>= player.GetVar("14543PassingPercentage")) { SetStatus("passed"); } else { SetStatus("failed"); } I published it as SCORM 1.2 course with following settings : Report Status to LMS : Passed / Failed Track using number of slides viewed Include HTML5 output (for mobile devices) After uploading it to Moodle as SCORM 1.2 package, it can't pass score value and status to Moodle on mobile devices only. But same course passes score and status to Moodle on desktop. So, i tested it on SCORM Cloud to identify any issue with my course. To my surprise, it can easily pass score and status to SCORM Cloud on mobile devices as well as desktop. I have tested with Moodle 2.6.5 and 3.1 with debugging and API Activity Log enabled. I noticed in the log it can't call the LMSSetValue (cmi.core.score.raw, min and max) on mobile devices. I have also attached the Articulate Storyline 2 course file (.story) , published output as SCORM 1.2 and Moodle API Activity Log. Kindly help me fix this issue asap.
