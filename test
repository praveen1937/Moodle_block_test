Providing facility for admin user to restrict access to External User Group.

Background: 


As per the customized code currently, any user who has the role of a 'Learner / Student' is auto enrolled and can view all Categories;
the Courses and Activities under the courses, maneuvering through the Left hand menu.

They can also add comments and open a discussion, if the option is allowed for the course; reply to comments made etc.

Client now has 2 custom users who were external and had to be allowed to see only one course in a specific category. Due to shortage of time, this was hard coded and access given.



Requirement:

The requirement thus is to restructure and provide users who have been assigned an Admin role, the flexibility to restrict the default access for a select group of 
users. Admin needs to have the rights to Sepeciy which courses can be viewed by these users.

This set of users are external and might be allowed to view only some courses in a specific category etc. and cannot add comments for discussion or view existing discussions etc.

Admin needs to be able to restrict this from the back end.


Deliverables :

Completed code ( following moodle coding best practices) committed to respective GIT repository provided and Code Review Checklist duly filled.

If required we can provide access to a To view the current application can


Do email if you require any clarifications. Also confirm if this can be taken up. If so we can provide:

-	A centric email id
-	Access to GIT repository
-	Access to AWS Dev. Instance to start work on, which has updated code etc.





A new role needs to be created called "External Student". There access is restricted to access activities. They are not auto enrolled in any courses. 

External Users are created and assigned "External Student role" outside of this plugin 

A new plugin will be developed :

This will have an option to list all the "External Student" as well as All the Courses with Categories.

Admin can choose set of users from the list and enroll them with some courses ( Bulk Enrollment)

These users will have access to view the course and they will not be able to view / participate on any activities.
